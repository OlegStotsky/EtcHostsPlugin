## Intellij /etc/hosts Support

Provides IDE support for /etc/hosts plugin.

## Features
Syntax highlighting, commenting, syntax errors highlighting

## Limitations
- Couldn't find a way to support regexp matching for file extension, so now you have to manually select file type
- Flex doesn't support negative lookbehinds, so couldn't add support for ipv6 ip addresses.
